# impact-summary-map-template-js

This interactive map highlights your area of interest and shows an interactive report based on its location, allowing you to leverage your analysis work. The data presented in the boxes, at the bottom of the map, can be any integer data allowing you to answer new questions about locations that you cannot answer with maps alone.

## Webfonts

This application uses a custom webfont created on [Fontello](http://fontello.com/). If you're hosting this application on your own server, make sure that it's configured to host the webfont files with the correct mime types. Some servers require a mime type set for these files to be able to serve them correctly. See the following URLs for more information. There is a zip archive of the webfont with it's fontello config in the "resources" folder in this repository.
